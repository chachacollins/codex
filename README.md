# CODEX
---
It's a literate programming preprocessor that parses markdown to extract the code blocks.
It should have been a bash script ngl.
# Usage
---
Git clone this repo. There you will find a code binary file.
```bash
./codex <input> <output>
```
You can also add it to your path but I'm not your dad so i'm not gonna tell what to do.

# Examples
Codex is self hosted so checkout codex.md for examples on how to use it.
